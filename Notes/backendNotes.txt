- JSON Location: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/posts/
- Make each Word have their own Database of Coordinates
    - the one we have now, is for the full json file. They should be modularised while editing, and only merged for output
    - no need for the word coordinate pair code bc each word will be looked at in isolation. just need to change the target databaseaq

### DJANGO SHELL ###
-- ACCESS SHELL --
python manage.py shell



-- IMPORT APP --
from PostApp.models import Post, Word
from PostApp.models import Coordinate, Word, WordCoordinates, Sentence, Image, ImageSet



-- ADD NEW WORDS AND COORDINATES TO A POST --
word1 = Word.objects.create(word="example1", coordinates=[0, 0])
word2 = Word.objects.create(word="example2", coordinates=[5, 5])

post = Post.objects.create(imageName="sample_image", imageLocation="path/to/image.jpg")



-- DELETE WORD --
Word.objects.filter(word='sample_word').delete()

-- DELETE COORDINATE --
Word.objects.filter(coordinates=[100,100]).delete()

-- DELETE WORD COORDINATE PAIR --
Word.objects.filter(word='TEST', coordinates=[4,4]).delete()


-- PRINT WORDS --
print(post.words.all())



-- PRINT ALL/DISTINCT WORDS AND COORDINATES --
all_words = Word.objects.all()

for word in all_words:
    print(f"Word: {word.word}, Coordinates: {word.coordinates}")


-- TEST
all_words = Word.objects.all().distinct('word')

for word in all_words:
    print(f"Word: {word.word}")

-- EXIT SHELL --
exit()



-- CONSIDERATIONS --
- How to handle multiple words with the same name?
    - Can't have duplicate entries in the database
    - Can't have duplicate entries in the json fil

- How to handle multiple words with the same coordinates?
    - Can't have duplicate entries in the database
    - Can't have duplicate entries in the json file

- Security Consideration: authentication and authorization in place to ensure that not just anyone can delete images. Depending on your use-case, you might want only logged-in users or even only admins to have the capability to delete images. This can be handled using Django's authentication system and permission classes if you're using Django Rest Framework.
